## Overview

Loan approval is a critical process for financial institutions. This project aims to build a predictive model using machine learning techniques to determine whether a loan should be approved or not based on applicant data. The model uses features such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and other relevant information.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model deployment script

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is obtained from [Kaggle's Loan Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset). It contains information on:

- Loan_ID
- Gender
- Married
- Dependents
- Education
- Self_Employed
- ApplicantIncome
- CoapplicantIncome
- LoanAmount
- Loan_Amount_Term
- Credit_History
- Property_Area
- Loan_Status

## Installation

Usage

1. Data Preprocessing:
   Run the data preprocessing script to clean and preprocess the dataset.
  
Bash
   python preprocess.py
   
2. Model Training:
   Train the model using the training script.
  
Bash
   python train.py
   
3. Prediction:
   Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
  
Bash
   python predict.py --input data/new_applicant_data.csv --output results/predictions.csv
   
## Model

The project uses a variety of machine learning algorithms to find the best model for predicting loan approval, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost

The model selection and evaluation are performed using cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness and accuracy.

## Results

The final model achieved an accuracy of 71% on the test set. Detailed performance metrics and visualizations can be found in the notebooks/results_analysis.ipynb notebook.
